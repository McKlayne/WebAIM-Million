### Data Dictionary and Data Notes
The basic data dictionary for the fields is at
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15oQSvx_mVwmCPJZ_llnoIb7zAXc_K-g4-Mx2ZrZMjwA/edit#gid=0
There are URLs there to http://wave.webaim.org/api/docs?format=html
which provides details on each of the WAVE "items".

Note that "rank" is the unique identifier and is the same across the
initial and follow-up data. The follow-up data has 936419 records due
to many of the home pages disappearing between February and August.

### Summary Report
Our summary report on the initial data is at
https://webaim.org/projects/million/ with the follow-up (August)
reanalysis summary at https://webaim.org/projects/million/update

### Some of the primary initial questions for me are:
- How do technologies align with accessibility features? - Answered
- How do technologies align with certain error types? - Answered
- Are there patterns or correlations of certain feature or alert types
to increased errors or error types? - Answered
- How can I better visualize the data to find other patterns or
correlations to explore further? - Answered
- Are there patterns of change between the two datasets that I have overlooked? - Next Semester

### Additional Questions:
- Does one specific error cause any other errors to be more prevalent?
